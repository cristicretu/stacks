## Running

Use the [space CLI](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/reference/cli#content) to create a new builder project on Deta Space.

```bash
space new
```

then run locally using

```bash
space dev
```

this will simulate the space environment, with a dev db, without any keys and what not.

To push your changes to space, and respectively create a release use

```bash
space push
# space release
```
